# Javascript Calculator

This project was the first project I made learning JavaScript, I took inspiration from a youtube video to build the very basic version of the calculator then decided to improve it.

# Improvements Made

- Added ability to change signs of inputed numbers
- Added support for standard keyboard inputs
- Fixed the input of numbers after operations were made
- Added feature of square roots
- Added feature of powers (x^n)
- Added pi input for convenience
